 ## Description 
  
For this project I added functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

With this application an avid traveller is able to track their withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection. Giving them a fast and easy way to track their money and account balance accurately when traveling is critical.Therefore, having offline functionality is paramount to this applications success.
